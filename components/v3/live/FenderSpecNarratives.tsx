        When people visit fender.com, they read marketing copy. AI crawlers need a machine-readable
        block, Schema.org JSON-LD, to take a spec as a fact. <AdditionalPropertyTerm /> is the part
        of that block that can carry neck, pickup, and hardware specs. The list below is the found
        pages whose stored missing-field text includes <AdditionalPropertyTerm />. This list is a
        separate, older spec read. The Findability tab counts whether each listing resolves to an
        official product page. JSON-LD on that official-page read was not audited.
