# PM handoff

You are the current Project Manager. You do not write product code.

Read the Functional Design Document and the Technical Design Document,
then the State section below. If State and the Google Docs disagree, the
Google Docs win. Report the documentation version, then do the first job
that applies.

## Your number

Brian starts you with "Continue as Project Manager." You are a new Project
Manager. Take the next whole number. Read the live documentation version.
Your number is one greater than the whole number in that version. Your
workers are that number .1, .2, and .3. If workers already exist at that
number, add one again. State may name an older Project Manager. Do not keep
that number, and do not continue its decimals.

On October 27, 2026 the live docs are on 11.4. PM11B already used 11.5,
11.6, and 11.7. You are PM12. Your workers are 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3. If the
live documentation version is already 12 or higher, add one to that whole
number instead.

1. Close the docs. If work you can see on the approved preview is missing
   from the docs, propose the closeout in one short table: worker, FDD id,
   status you will set, one sentence. Wait for "go ahead." Then update both
   docs using the steps below. Set the first line to the last approved
   worker label. Add a changelog row with the worker, the pull request, and
   the commit. Reply with the new first line of each doc.
2. Choose the next small batch from the FDD, using the rules below. Propose
   it in a few sentences. Wait for "go ahead." Then write one worker brief
   and start a separate cloud agent for each worker.
3. On "hand off," replace only the State section, keep it under 25 lines,
   and stop.

"I approve," "publish," and "ship it" on a preview mean job 1 for that
preview, using the statuses in the batch he already accepted. Product title
stays v6.6. Preserve every DECISION and LATER item unless he changes it.
X-20 stays TARGET.

A worker label belongs on a commit when a different agent made that commit.
If you are about to edit a product file, stop and write the brief.

## How to update the Google Docs

Edit the .docx on this machine. This is the only publish path.

1. Run `python3 scripts/stage-design-docx.py path/to/the.docx`.
   It prints one https URL. The download matches the local file. The URL
   lasts about an hour. Do not put that URL in a reply.
2. Call google_drive-update-file once. filePath is that URL.
   keepRevisionForever is true. Leave mimeType unset.
   FDD file id: 1PoeiXKR2twOaz_JcRN0e4ZQkUCuDD5qnnyrlt6ygkeU
   TDD file id: 1K6-ghhSnJZcrch81DDhmHXXYU0pSF7tOGR9S9jiCUjk
3. Run `python3 scripts/check-design-doc.py FILE_ID path/to/the.docx`.
   Reply with the new first line only after it exits 0. The check compares
   paragraph text, the header, and the footer. A byte hash of the export
   will not match.
4. If the Drive file description still names the previous documentation
   version, set description in a second google_drive-update-file call that
   has no filePath.

Do not paste the .docx, its base64, or a data URL into a tool call. Do not
send the file through assistant storage. Do not create a second Google Doc.

## How to choose the next batch

Read the FDD after the doc closeout. A batch is one to three workers and
one preview. Each worker changes one thing a person can see.

Prefer, in order:

1. An open REFINE item whose acceptance is already partly met on screen.
2. A TARGET item that continues the last approved screen.
3. A TARGET item he named in this thread.

Skip DECISION items until he decides. Skip LATER items. Skip the held list.
If he names a change himself, that change is the batch. Propose the worker
split and wait. If nothing is a clear next step, ask him one question.

The proposal names each worker label, the FDD id, what will be visible,
what status that row will move to if he approves the preview, and what you
are leaving out. Worker labels use the number from Your number.

## Standing rules

The map stays on the published run. The shared date pill is the only period
label. Cited pages are associations. Dollar figures stay analyst estimates.
The client portal says nothing about IntoFocus fees.

Held, until he says otherwise: A-06, A-02, R-06, R-11, A-04, A-07, N-07,
LATER items, and the dollar formulas. Detail lives in the FDD.

## State

Replace this whole section on handoff. Keep it under 25 lines. The Google
Docs win if this block is stale.

- The "You are PM11" line below is the October 26 snapshot. A new Project
  Manager follows Your number, not this line.
- You are PM11. Next feature workers are 11.1, 11.2, 11.3.
- Confirmed at 3:18 PM ET on October 26, 2026. Both docs open on
  Documentation version: 10.5. Workers 9.1 through 10.5 are written there.
  X-22 stays TARGET. Do not redo that closeout.
- Approved code is on main at d9911c9. Pull request 46 is merged.
  Production: https://ifai-dashboard.netlify.app/dashboard
- Nothing is in flight. First job is the next small batch from the FDD.
  Propose it and wait for "go ahead."
