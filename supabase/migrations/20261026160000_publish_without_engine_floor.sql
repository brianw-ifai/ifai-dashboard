-- Publish a finished AI Search run with the answers that were collected.
-- Idempotent. Does not publish a run by itself.
--
-- The live function had grown a per-engine floor: any engine under 70%
-- answered raised "engine below 70% answered" and the run stayed unpublished.
-- That floor is removed. Provider errors remain on the run and stay visible.
-- A run still has to be completed or partial, match the active prompt set,
-- and store one row for every expected call.
